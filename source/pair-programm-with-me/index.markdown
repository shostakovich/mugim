I love my craft. I program on interesting [projects][1] in my free time. No reason to do this alone!

Here is my offer: I will pair program with you! For free. You just have to ask.

## Pair program on what?

Pick any Open Source or non-commercial project â€” something that we can achieve in 1 or 2 hours. Tell me, what we are going to do, so that I can prepare.

## Wait - which language?

If you are the driver - I don't care that much. I tried a lot of languages over the years and I should be able to understand, what you are doing.

If you want me to be the driver Ruby or PHP would be best.


## How?

We could use ScreenHero or SSH && VIM && Tmux. You can have a look at how this works [here][3].

## How to contact me

Just use the comment form below, write me an [email][2] or ask me via [Twitter][4].
