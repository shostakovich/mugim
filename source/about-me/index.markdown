My name is Robert Curth. I am 28 years old and live in Munich (Germany).

I am a programmer at [Gutefrage.net][1].

Currently I help maintaining our plattforms [helpster.de][2] and [pointoo.de][3].

After work I programm, try to learn english, french, play the guitar, walk around the nearby lake, eat steaks, drink a good mug full of coffee, or read a good book.

I also obsess about health, fitness and food and I love Shostakovich.
