Hi. My name is Robert Curth. I am 29 years old and live in Munich (Germany).

## Programmer

I am a programmer at Gutefrage.net. I program in Ruby (on Rails) these days on [helpster.de][2] and [pointoo.de][3].

Since we take care of our own infrastructure, I also know a little bit about Chef and server configuration.

## Cultural hacker

I boost our company culture by organizing events and bringing people together.

I also established some regular events at Gutefrage like the OpenHack Munich, our IT drinkup, a group where we polish our presentation skills, a company wide lunch and some more ;)

Great company cultures exist, because people just start living them. I try to do this.

## Traveler

I travel a lot. I visited ~33 countries during my lifetime. Most of them in the last 3 years.

I think that traveling, made me a better person.

This is me eating ice, while watching onto the Antarctica peninsula. To understand my facial expression, you should know that I am on a low carb diet and was kind of surprised ;)

## Self-improver

After work I try to invest into my skills and mind. That means: I exercise, meditate and do all other kinds of crazy stuff.

I try to be systematic about it â€” you can follow my progress on [Lift][12].
