I recently installed "Die Siedler II" on Mac OS X - this is how I pulled
it of.

* If you don't have the game - [go buy it][1]
* Open [WineBottler][2]
* Create custom prefix
* Select the .exe file and check one of the DirectX dll's

* Install it
* Now right click on the program WineBottler created
* Open the package
* Copy the Settlers II folder from Contents/Resources/drive_c/COG
GAMES/ into another Folder
* Download [BoxerApp][3]

* Click onto "Import new Game"
* Drag the Settlers II folder onto the window

* Thats it! Launch the game!

Well. That's it! Enjoy.
