I am collecting quite a lot of data on a continual basis:

* Blood pressure
* Steps
* Weight
* Tracked habits
* GitHub commits
* Follower counts
* RSVP's for the events we host at Gutefrage.net

That's why I decided to visualize it on a personal dashboard. This weekend, I invested a few hours and came up with this:

{% img /images/uploads/2013-07/dashboard.jpg %}

I created a [GeckoBoard][1], because that's what we use at the Helpster Team at Gutefrage.

All the widgets including Meetup.com, Twitter and FitBit are available on GeckoBoard already. The only widget that I had to populate myself was the [Lift.do indicator][2].

## Conclusion

Is the GeckoBoard worth 19$'s a month? I don't know. 

Probably I will switch to something like Panic's [Statusboard][3] - but this requires a little more effort â€” I am not sure to invest this time until I know that a personal dashboard makes a difference.

Did you guy's try something similar? Then please tell me in the comments below.
