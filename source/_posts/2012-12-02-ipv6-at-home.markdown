Recently I listened to a fantastic episode of "[Chaosradio Express][1]", that covered IPv6 in great detail. I never realized how usefull it is, in order to adress my computers at home.

So I decided to set up a free account for IPv6 through IPv4 tunneling at SixXs. 


## The Result

Without having to set up dyndns I can just do:
    
    $ ssh mbair.zipf

This article describes how you can do the same.

## Set up the first tunnel

Its relatively simple. Here are the steps I had to do until it worked.

 * sign up on [this][2] page.
 * confirm your email-address
 * wait for your account to be activated
 * [Request a tunnel][3] (AYIYA variant)
 * wait for the tunnel to be activated
 * download the [tunnel driver for Mac OS X][4]
 * alt-klick on the pkg and install it
 * brew install aiccu
 * set user/pw in /usr/local/etc/aiccu.conf with your login
 * set ipv6_interface in your aicuu.conf to tun0
 * restart you're Mac
 * **Dont forget to turn on your firewall. You have your own public IP in a minute**
 * Last but not least start the tunnel:

	sudo /usr/local/sbin/aiccu start

You should have connectivity now. You can check it by pinging another IPv6 enabled host. For example:

    ping6 google.com
    PING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) 2001:4dd0:ff00:f7e::2 --> 2a00:1450:4016:800::1003
    16 bytes from 2a00:1450:4016:800::1003, icmp_seq=0 hlim=55 time=80.803 ms
    16 bytes from 2a00:1450:4016:800::1003, icmp_seq=1 hlim=55 time=116.723 ms
    16 bytes from 2a00:1450:4016:800::1003, icmp_seq=2 hlim=55 time=80.783 ms
    16 bytes from 2a00:1450:4016:800::1003, icmp_seq=3 hlim=55 time=77.813 ms

## Setting up the second tunnel

Sixxs has a credit system, in order to only give ressources to user, who mean it - so you have keep your first tunnel active for about one week, before you can request a second tunnel. This one you can use for you devices at home.
        
Aftwerwads you can reach them from the outside.

## The end

I hope you find it as useful as me :)
