I own my FitBit 'The One' for a few months now. I also owned the predeccesor and I think it's a great upgrade.

In this post I want to review it.

## Why should you track your steps?

After I first got my Fitbit Ultra, I immediately started to move around more. After a few steps I got my first badge and it was kind of fun. In the first few weeks I challenged myself and climbed 100 floors in one day.

The FitBit provided daily feedback and I watch on the screen all the time to get feedback, how many steps are still left.

After one year I move more than ever and have increased my goal for the steps to 12500 per day.
