I am quite exited about Avdi Grimm's new project [Ruby Tapas][1]. 

3 times a week Avdi post short videos about different concepts and techniques in Ruby.

The first 3 episodes were short, but I already learned some obscure details of Ruby that I didn't know about. 

I think that over many weeks, that should give me a pretty solid knowledge of the parts of Ruby that I do not touch in my daily work.
