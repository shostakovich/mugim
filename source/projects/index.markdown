## Active Projects

Here are some of the project that I worked on. There are a few more -
especially side projects.. But most of them are not worth mentioning ;) 

### Helpster.de + Pointoo.de

Currently I work on helpster.de and pointoo.de.

Both plattforms are written in Rails and consist of a few more Rails
projects for the backend as well.

It's amazing to work with Rails.

## Discontinued Projects

### NabPHP

[NabPHP](https://code.google.com/p/nabphp/) was a PHP wrapper for the NabazTag API.
Unfortunately the API does not work any more and my poor little Rabbit
is dead.


### Gutefrage.net

Gutefrage.net is written in Symfony (PHP). I worked in the Gutefrage  scrum team for around one year, then I decided to switch to Rails.

### YiGG.de

{% img /images/uploads/2012-12/yigg.jpg %}

I started my professional career 2008 at YiGG. YiGG is a german plattform for social news. I helped rewriting the plattform in PHP 5 + Symfony.

I also wrote stuff like the Worldspy (scans RSS feeds + Twitter for the best news) and our thumbnail generator in PhantomJS. It was quite a nice time and I learned a ton.

### Appstar.tv

Appstar is an award for the best iDevice apps in germany. On the website you can vote for the best apps. The website keeps the informations of the Apps up to date using the broken Apple AppStore API. Its written in Symfony +
Diem.

### Microsites

A simple application to remember what to do and what you did. In the terminal, clutter free and completly unspectacular.
